# Interactive coding exercise

## Overview

This repo contains a starter project for a simple key/value database server. During the interview exercise, you will pair with another Software Engineer to extend the functionality of the server.

The starter project is available in both Python and Javascript variants.

For more information on the web frameworks used, please refer to the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and [Restify](http://restify.com/docs/home/) documentation.

Many thanks to [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) for the inspiration for this exercise.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The runtimes and libraries required to run either sample are contained in Docker images built from this repo. To run these examples, you must have the following tools installed:

* Docker 19.03+
* Docker Compose 1.17+

### Running the project

To run either sample project, navigate to the appropriate directory and execute a `docker-compose up`.

```shell
$ cd python
$ docker-compose up
```

```shell
$ cd javascript
$ docker-compose up
```

The server will be running at <http://localhost:8080>.
